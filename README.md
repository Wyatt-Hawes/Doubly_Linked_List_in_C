Lex and List
==============
- All code made by myself

List.c
---------
> The doubly linked list data structure used in Lex and that can be used for other purposes as well
> View List.h for specific functions relating on how to use the List

Lex
---------
> usage "Lex <input> <output>" sorts the input file line by line
> Uses the List.h as an ADT in order to accomplish this
